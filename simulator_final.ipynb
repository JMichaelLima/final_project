The scene to write is based on a previous game scene which read As you march deeper into the shadow-ridden corridor of the alley, an eerie chill seems to seep through your very bones. The flickering of an old gaslight, hanging precariously at a bend further ahead, casts ghostly shadows that dance upon the decrepit walls. The narrow path, bounded by the looming, derelict structures, beckons you silently under the cloak of an ever-thickening fog. Its wisps whisper secrets of forgotten tales and hidden fears. No sound dares break the haunting silence save for your solitary footsteps, which resound with a hollow echo against the ancient cobblestones. Mysterious inscriptions etched onto the walls near the gaslight seem to pulsate faintly with a timeless forewarning, urging caution with each solitary step forward. and the player chose to move forward. at 7:00 PM. Do not name the player or give them any tools or weapons. Please return a detailed JSON object with keys for 'story', 'scene_description', and 'player_options'. The JSON object structure must be as follows:  The scene description is to be used by Dall-E to generate a visualization of the story you are generating from the player's first-person perspective. The scene description should be detailed and vivid. Always feature at least one path for the player to move in. The scene_description MUST be under 500 characters. The player options should include only those directions that are explicitly mentioned in the scene description (e.g., if the scene describes a pathway leading forward, only 'forward' should be an option). Additionally, include an option to 'back', allowing the player to go back to the previous location. 'player_options' should be structured as an object with a 'direction' key which should be an array containing the direction (the options here are 'forward', 'left', 'right', 'back' only) and a 'command text' like ['forward', 'Continue down alley'], consisting of three words maximum and a 'transition_text' key. The transition_text should describe the action of moving in that direction as it happens, like 'As you step forward, your shoes echo on the cobblestone, piercing the silence as the fog envelops you like a cold embrace.' Keep these texts to one or two sentences. JSON object structure must be as follows: story, scene_description, player_options. player_options should contain 'directions' which will have all available directions that player can move. each direction should contain the 'direction', 'command_text', and 'transition_text'.\"}]\n"
